## Name origin

When flirting with possible names, the main contributor duo of this repository 
looked for iconic moments involving cryptography, mysteries, enigmas and the like. 
Unsuccessful Daniel, in an epiphany, recalled a group famous for its enigmatic acts 
in recent years: `Cicada 3301`. [Cicada 3301 is a nickname given to an enigmatic organization that, 
on three occasions, has posted a set of puzzles to recruit codebreakers from the public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada_3301).

So, the mental acrobatics started to get an interesting name for the group based on this reference.
First we get the algorithm `rot n` and applied as following:

rot(3301, "cicada") = bhbzcz

Where by taking each initial you get the sentence at the beginning of this README.

> _*"Be hideous before zeal cease zealotry".*_

Furthermore, interest in the word "Zealotry" arose. 
The etymology of the word indicates that: The Zealots were a political movement 
in 1st-century Second Temple Judaism which sought to incite the people of Judea 
Province to rebel against the Roman Empire and expel it from the Holy Land by 
force of arms, most notably during the First Jewish–Roman War (66–70). 
_**Zealotry**_ was the term used by Josephus for a "fourth sect" or 
"fourth Jewish philosophy" during this period.
